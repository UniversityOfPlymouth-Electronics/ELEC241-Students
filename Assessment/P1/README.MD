# Preapration for the P1 coursework

## Lab
Please ensure you have completed the [lab on SPI interfacing](/Labs/Topics-01-VHDL/08-CaseStudy-SPI)

## Examples 
1. Simple SPI to control LEDs and read switches. This demonstrates the "full duplex" communication that is provided by the SPI standard

2. An example of 3-wire SPI. This shows how data is acquired from the on-board accelerometer and passed back to the Microcontroller to build a simple movement detector

3. An example of multiple-SPI devices. Note how the data and clock lines are shared, but a separate chip select is used.
